# vue-wiki-test

This is part of a private wiki project implemented in Vue.js with the help of [tiptap](https://github.com/heyscrumpy/tiptap/).

A lot of the functionality I've removed lives on the django api side of things, but this repo should be able to load the wiki editor and history browser.

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

npm run serve
```
